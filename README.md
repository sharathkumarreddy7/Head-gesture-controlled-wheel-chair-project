# Head-gesture-controlled-wheel-chair-project
Head Gesture controlled model Wheel Chair by Sharath Kumar Reddy

This project helps in the easy motion of patients with phocomelia and other paralysis problems. They can move as per their wish, just with their head gestures.I have used MPU6050(Accelerometer+gyroscope) to detect changes in angles and rotation speed.
- An Accelerometer helps in detecting motion in all 3 dimensions x,y,z.
- A gyroscope helps in detecting the speed of motion and angles. 

The Arduino microcontroller is used to analyze the signals from MPU6050. The project code is written in such a way that it gets synchronized between motors rotation and speed.
Hence the wheels work accordingly.
