This project helps in the easy motion of patients with phocomelia and other paralysis problems. They can move as per their wish, just with their head gestures.I have used MPU6050(Accelerometer+gyroscope) to detect changes in angles and rotation speed.
- An Accelerometer helps in detecting motion in all 3 dimensions x,y,z.
- A gyroscope helps in detecting the speed of motion and angles. 

The Arduino microcontroller is used to analyze the signals from MPU6050. The project code is written in such a way that it gets synchronized between motors rotation and speed.
Hence the wheels work accordingly.
